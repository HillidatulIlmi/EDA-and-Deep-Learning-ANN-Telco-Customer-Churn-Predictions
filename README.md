Churn is a measurement of the percentage of accounts that cancel or choose not to renew their subscriptions. A high churn rate can negatively impact Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) and can also indicate dissatisfaction with a product or service.

Churn is the measure of how many customers stop using a product. This can be measured based on actual usage or failure to renew (when the product is sold using a subscription model). Often evaluated for a specific period of time, there can be a monthly, quarterly, or annual churn rate.

The data set includes information about:
- Customers who left within the last month => the column is called Churn
- Services that each customer has signed up for => phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information => how long they been a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, and total charges
- Demographic info about customers => gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents
